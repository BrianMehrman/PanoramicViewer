These are a few action script 3 files i created to make a panoramic viewer.

To use these files create a flash project in the same directory as one of these as3 files. Reference the name of the file, or the class on the stage of the flash file. Add your panoramic jpg naming it "pano.jpg" or change the code to match your jpg.

Oh and one more thing you need papervision downloaded and referenced in your flash file. I will add more info on how to do this later. For now...sleep.

That is all.
